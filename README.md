### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Teena!

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a growing interest in cloud technologies. My journey in tech blends creativity with precision, where I've developed skills in JavaScript, React.js, C#/.NET Core, and Python for building scalable, data-driven applications.

Currently, I'm contributing to a volunteer project using Angular, .NET 9 with Entity Framework, and PostgreSQLâ€”further sharpening my skills in modern front-end and back-end technologies. I'm also actively exploring Azure services, particularly Azure Blob Storage, to better understand scalable cloud-based file handling and storage solutions.

With a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering and hands-on experience in designing intuitive UIs, optimizing backend workflows, and leveraging data for insights, I thrive in dynamic environments that value innovation and problem-solving.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring

1. Full Stack Development: Advancing my skills in building scalable web applications using Angular (signals-based state), C#/.NET Core 9, PostgreSQL, and Azure services. Currently applying these in a volunteer project with an emphasis on Clean Architecture.
2. Clean Architecture: Writing modular, testable, and maintainable code by applying principles like separation of concerns, dependency inversion, and domain-driven design.
3. Developer Productivity: Exploring tools and workflows that streamline development, including:
 - GitHub Copilot for intelligent code suggestions,
 - OpenAPI Generator for auto-generating strongly typed Angular and .NET clients from Swagger specs,
 - EF Core Migrations for efficient database schema management and versioning.
4. Data Structures and Algorithms: Practicing DSA regularly to reinforce problem-solving and code optimization skills.
5. Professional Growth: Staying up to date through hands-on projects, technical communities, and continuous learning opportunities.

Thanks for stopping by! Let's connect and explore the fascinating world of technology together. ðŸš€
